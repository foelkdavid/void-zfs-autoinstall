# Void - ZFS - Installer

Automated Void Installation on ZFS.
Ecryption included :)

The system will be boot directly from EFI into "zfsbootmenu".
EFI boot is therefore required for this installer to work.

This Installer is based on the Guide provided here:
https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/v2.2.x/guides/void-linux/uefi.html
